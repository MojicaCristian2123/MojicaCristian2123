- 👋 Hi, my name is Cristian Mojica (@MojicaCristian2123), and I am an MS Statistics candidate at San Diego State University in San Diego, CA. I am a mathematics tutor with specialization in statistics, and I am also a student member of the American Statistical Association (ASA).
- 👀 I’m interested in statistical analysis as it is applied to the biological sciences and public health, psychology, educational analytics, and social science. I am also interested in statistical education.
- 🌱 I am currently learning machine learning methods and Bayesian time series analysis in the break between the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters.
      Upon the start of the Spring 2023 semester, I will be taking the following courses: survival analysis, multivariate analysis, biostatistics, spatiotemporal methods, and data analysis methods.
- 💞️ I am seeking statistical work (entry-level, ideally) starting in June or July 2023 in the state of California, particularly in San Diego, CA.
